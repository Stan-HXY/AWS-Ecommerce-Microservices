/**
 * <p>Removes the specified targets from the specified rule. When the rule is triggered, those
 *       targets are no longer be invoked.</p>
 *
 *          <note>
 *             <p>A successful execution of <code>RemoveTargets</code> doesn't guarantee all targets are removed from the rule, it means that the target(s) listed in the request are removed.</p>
 *          </note>
 *
 *          <p>When you remove a target, when the associated rule triggers, removed targets might
 *       continue to be invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.</p>
 *
 *          <p>This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that
 *       happens, <code>FailedEntryCount</code> is non-zero in the response and each entry in
 *         <code>FailedEntries</code> provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EventBridgeClient, RemoveTargetsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-eventbridge"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EventBridgeClient, RemoveTargetsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-eventbridge"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EventBridgeClient(config);
 * const command = new RemoveTargetsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link RemoveTargetsCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link RemoveTargetsCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EventBridgeClientResolvedConfig | config} for EventBridgeClient's `config` shape.
