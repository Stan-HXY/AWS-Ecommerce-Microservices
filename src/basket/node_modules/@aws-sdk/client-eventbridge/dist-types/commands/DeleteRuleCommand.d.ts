/**
 * <p>Deletes the specified rule.</p>
 *          <p>Before you can delete the rule, you must remove all targets, using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_RemoveTargets.html">RemoveTargets</a>.</p>
 *
 *          <p>When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to the deleted rule. Allow
 *       a short period of time for changes to take effect.</p>
 *
 *          <p>If you call delete rule multiple times for the same rule, all calls will succeed. When you
 *       call delete rule for a non-existent custom eventbus, <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is
 *       returned.</p>
 *
 *          <p>Managed rules are rules created and managed by another Amazon Web Services service on your behalf. These
 *       rules are created by those other Amazon Web Services services to support functionality in those services. You
 *       can delete these rules using the <code>Force</code> option, but you should do so only if you
 *       are sure the other service is not still using that rule.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EventBridgeClient, DeleteRuleCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-eventbridge"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EventBridgeClient, DeleteRuleCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-eventbridge"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EventBridgeClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteRuleCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteRuleCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteRuleCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EventBridgeClientResolvedConfig | config} for EventBridgeClient's `config` shape.
