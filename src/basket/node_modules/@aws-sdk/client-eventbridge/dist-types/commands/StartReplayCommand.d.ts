/**
 * <p>Starts the specified replay. Events are not necessarily replayed in the exact same order
 *       that they were added to the archive. A replay processes events to replay based on the time in
 *       the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If you specify an
 *         <code>EventStartTime</code> and an <code>EventEndTime</code> that covers a 20 minute time
 *       range, the events are replayed from the first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the
 *       events from the second minute are replayed. You can use <code>DescribeReplay</code> to
 *       determine the progress of a replay. The value returned for <code>EventLastReplayedTime</code>
 *       indicates the time within the specified time range associated with the last event
 *       replayed.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EventBridgeClient, StartReplayCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-eventbridge"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EventBridgeClient, StartReplayCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-eventbridge"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EventBridgeClient(config);
 * const command = new StartReplayCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link StartReplayCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link StartReplayCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EventBridgeClientResolvedConfig | config} for EventBridgeClient's `config` shape.
